# Polynomial Guessing
## What does this program do
This program takes input points of the form (x,y), and then predicts the closest polynomial that can be represented by these points. This polynomial is printed in Output.txt generated by the program.

## How to run this program
First you need to have data having two columns. The first column has values of x and the second one has values of y. Also the first row should contain the line "x y".
Let this file has name input_file.txt
Now go to the directory named Polynomial_Guessing and type in the terminal : 
`python polynomial.py -df input_file.txt`
This will run the model with default values, to run your own loss function you can give an optional argument -lf. This can also be accessed using the help option -h. That is type :
`python polynomial.py -h`
This will print the following data: 
-h, --help            show this help message and exit
-lf , --loss_function
                      Enter the loss function for gradient 1: Mean Square, 2: Mean Absolute, 3: Mean Root, 4: Cross Entropy, 5: Log-Cosh
-rp , --reg_para      Enter the regularization parameter. 0 for none
-df , --data_file     Enter the address of the data file to be used

### Happy Guessing!!
